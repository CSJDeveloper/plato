## Plato: A New Framework for Federated Learning Research

Welcome to *Plato*, a new software framework to facilitate scalable federated learning research.

### Installing Plato with PyTorch

To install *Plato*, first clone this repository to the desired directory.

The *Plato* developers recommend using [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) to manage Python packages. Before using *Plato*, first install [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html), update your `conda` environment, and then create a new `conda` environment with Python 3.8 using the command:

```shell
$ conda update conda
$ conda create -n federated python=3.8
$ conda activate federated
```

where `federated` is the preferred name of your new environment.

Update any packages, if necessary by typing `y` to proceed.

The next step is to install the required Python packages. PyTorch should be installed following the advice of its [getting started website](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/). The typical command in Linux with CUDA GPU support, for example, would be:

```shell
$ conda install pytorch torchvision torchaudio cudatoolkit=11.1 -c pytorch -c nvidia
```

The CUDA version, used in the command above, can be obtained on Ubuntu Linux systems by using the command:

```shell
nvidia-smi
```

In macOS (without GPU support), the typical command would be:

```shell
$ conda install pytorch torchvision -c pytorch
```

We will need to install several packages using `pip` as well:

```shell
$ pip install -r requirements.txt --upgrade
```

Finally, we will install Plato as a pip package:

```shell
$ pip install .
```

If you use Visual Studio Code, it is possible to use `yapf` to reformat the code every time it is saved by adding the following settings to .`.vscode/settings.json`:

```
"python.formatting.provider": "yapf", 
"editor.formatOnSave": true
```

In general, the following is the recommended starting point for `.vscode/settings.json`:

```
"python.linting.enabled": true,
"python.linting.pylintEnabled": true,
"python.formatting.provider": "yapf", 
"editor.formatOnSave": true,
"python.linting.pylintArgs": [
    "--init-hook",
    "import sys; sys.path.append('/absolute/path/to/project/home/directory')"
],
"workbench.editor.enablePreview": false
```

It goes without saying that `/absolute/path/to/project/home/directory` should be replaced with the actual path in the specific development environment.

**Tip:** When working in Visual Studio Code as the development environment, one of the project developer's colour theme favourites is called `Bluloco`, both of its light and dark variants are excellent and very thoughtfully designed. The `Pylance` extension is also strongly recommended, which represents Microsoft's modern language server for Python.

### Running Plato in a Docker container

Most of the codebase in *Plato* is designed to be framework-agnostic, so that it is relatively straightfoward to use *Plato* with a variety of deep learning frameworks beyond PyTorch, which is the default framwork it is using. One example of such deep learning frameworks that *Plato* currently supports is [MindSpore 1.1.1](https://www.mindspore.cn). Due to the wide variety of tricks that need to be followed correctly for running *Plato* without Docker, it is strongly recommended to run Plato in a Docker container, on either a CPU-only or a GPU-enabled server.

To build such a Docker image, use the provided `Dockerfile` for PyTorch and `Dockerfile_MindSpore` for MindSpore:

```shell
docker build -t plato -f Dockerfile .
```

or:

```shell
docker build -t plato -f Dockerfile_MindSpore .
```

To run the docker image that was just built, use the command:

```shell
./dockerrun.sh
```

Or if GPUs are available, use the command:

```shell
./dockerrun_gpu.sh
```

To remove all the containers after they are run, use the command:

```shell
docker rm $(docker ps -a -q)
```

To remove the `plato` Docker image, use the command:

```shell
docker rmi plato
```

On Ubuntu Linux, you may need to add `sudo` before these `docker` commands.

The provided `Dockerfile` helps to build a Docker image running Ubuntu 20.04, with a virtual environment called `plato` pre-configured to support PyTorch 1.8.1 and Python 3.8. 

If MindSpore support is needed, the provided `Dockerfile_MindSpore` contains two pre-configured environments for CPU and GPU environments, respectively, called `plato_cpu` or `plato_gpu`. They support [MindSpore 1.1.1](https://github.com/mindspore-ai/mindspore) and Python 3.7.5 (which is the Python version that MindSpore requires). Both Dockerfiles have GPU support enabled. Once an image is built and a Docker container is running, one can use Visual Studio Code to connect to it and start development within the container.

### Installing YOLOv5 as a Python package

If object detection using the YOLOv5 model and any of the COCO datasets is needed, it is necessary to install YOLOv5 as a Python package first:

```shell
cd packages/yolov5
pip install .
```
### Running Plato

To start a federated learning training workload, run [`run`](run) from the repository's root directory. For example:

```shell
./run --config=configs/MNIST/fedavg_lenet5.yml
```

* `--config` (`-c`): the path to the configuration file to be used. The default is `config.yml` in the project's home directory.
* `--log` (`-l`): the level of logging information to be written to the console. Possible values are `critical`, `error`, `warn`, `info`, and `debug`, and the default is `info`.

*Plato* uses the YAML format for its configuration files to manage the runtime configuration parameters. Example configuration files have been provided in the `configs` directory.

*Plato* can opt to use `wandb` to produce and collect logs in the cloud. If this is needed, add `use_wandb: true` to the `trainer` section in your configuration file.

### Potential Runtime Errors

If runtime exceptions occur that prevent a federated learning session from running to completion, the potential issues could be:

* Out of CUDA memory.

  *Potential solutions:* Decrease the number of clients selected in each round (with the *client simulation mode* turned on); decrease the `max_concurrency` value in the `trainer` section in your configuration file; decrease the  `batch_size` used in the `trainer` section.
 
* The time that a client waits for the server to respond before disconnecting is too short. This could happen when training with large neural network models. If you get an `AssertionError` saying that there are not enough launched clients for the server to select, this could be the reason. But make sure you first check if it is due to the *out of CUDA memory* error.

  *Potential solutions:* Add `ping_timeout` in the `server` section in your configuration file. The default value for `ping_timeout` is 20 (seconds). You could specify a larger timeout value, such as 120.

  For example, to run a training session with the CIFAR-10 dataset and the ResNet-18 model, and if 10 clients are selected per round, `ping_timeout` needs to be 120. Consider an even larger number if you run with larger models and more clients.

* Running processes have not been terminated from previous runs. 

  *Potential solutions:* Use the command `pkill python` to terminate them so that there will not be CUDA errors in the upcoming run.

### Client Simulation Mode

Plato supports a *client simulation mode*, in which the actual number of client processes launched equals the number of clients to be selected by the server per round, rather than the total number of clients. This supports a simulated federated learning environment, where the set of selected clients by the server will be simulated by the set of client processes actually running. For example, with a total of 10000 clients, if the server only needs to select 100 of them to train their models in each round, only 100 client processes will be launched in client simulation mode, and a client process may assume a different client ID in each round.

To turn on the client simulation mode, add `simulation: true` to the `clients` section in the configuration file.

### Plotting Runtime Results

If the configuration file contains a `results` section, the selected performance metrics, such as accuracy, will be saved in a `.csv` file in the `results/` directory. By default, the `results/` directory is under the path to the used configuration file, but it can be easily changed by modifying `Config.result_dir` in [`config.py`](config.py).

As `.csv` files, these results can be used however one wishes; an example Python program, called `plot.py`, plots the necessary figures and saves them as PDF files. To run this program:

```shell
python plot.py --config=config.yml
```

* `--config` (`-c`): the path to the configuration file to be used. The default is `config.yml` in the project's home directory.

### Running Unit Tests

All unit tests are in the `tests/` directory. These tests are designed to be standalone and executed separately. For example, the command `python lr_schedule_tests.py` runs the unit tests for learning rate schedules.

### Installing Plato with MindSpore

Plato is designed to support multiple deep learning frameworks, including PyTorch, TensorFlow, and MindSpore. For MindSpore support, Plato currently supports MindSpore 1.1.1 (1.2.1 and 1.3.0 are not supported, as [they do not support `Tensor` objects to be pickled](https://gitee.com/mindspore/mindspore/issues/I43RPP?from=project-issue) and sent over a network). Though we provided a `Dockerfile` for building a Docker container that supports MindSpore 1.1.1, in rare cases it may still be necessary to install Plato with MindSpore in a GPU server running Ubuntu Linux 18.04 (which MindSpore requires). Similar to a PyTorch installation, we need to first create a new environment with Python 3.7.5 (which MindSpore 1.1.1 requires), and then install the required packages:

```shell
conda create -n mindspore python=3.7.5
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

We should now install MindSpore 1.1.1 with the command provided by the [official MindSpore website](https://mindspore.cn/install).

MindSpore 1.1.1 may also need additional packages, which should installed if they do not exist:

```shell
sudo apt-get install libssl-dev
sudo apt-get install build-essential
```

If CuDNN has not yet been installed, it needs to be installed with the following commands:

```shell
wget https://developer.download.nvidia.com/compute/cuda/repos/ubuntu1804/x86_64/cuda-ubuntu1804.pin
sudo mv cuda-ubuntu1804.pin /etc/apt/preferences.d/cuda-repository-pin-600
sudo apt-key adv --fetch-keys https://developer.download.nvidia.com/compute/cuda/repos/ubuntu1804/x86_64/7fa2af80.pub
sudo add-apt-repository "deb https://developer.download.nvidia.com/compute/cuda/repos/ubuntu1804/x86_64/ /"
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install libcudnn8=8.0.5.39-1+cuda10.1
```

To check the current CuDNN version, the following commands are helpful:

```shell
function lib_installed() { /sbin/ldconfig -N -v $(sed 's/:/ /' <<< $LD_LIBRARY_PATH) 2>/dev/null | grep $1; }
function check() { lib_installed $1 && echo "$1 is installed" || echo "ERROR: $1 is NOT installed"; }
check libcudnn
```

To check if MindSpore is correctly installed on the GPU server, try to run the command:

```shell
python -c "import mindspore"
```

Finally, to use trainers and servers based on MindSpore, assign `true` to `use_mindspore` in the `trainer` section of the configuration file. If GPU is not available when MindSpore is used, assign `true` to `cpuonly` in the `trainer` section as well. These variables are unassigned by default, and *Plato* would use PyTorch as its default framework.

### Deploying Plato Servers in a Production Environment in the Cloud

The Plato federated learning server is designed to use Socket.IO over HTTP and HTTPS, and can be easily deployed in a production server environment in the public cloud. See `/docs/Deploy.md` for more details on how the nginx web server can be used as a reverse proxy for such a deployment in production servers.

### Uninstalling Plato

Remove the `conda` environment used to run *Plato* first, and then remove the directory containing *Plato*'s git repository.

```shell
conda-env remove -n federated
rm -rf plato/
```

where `federated` (or `mindspore`) is the name of the `conda` environment that *Plato* runs in.

For more specific documentation on how Plato can be run on GPU cluster environments such as Google Colaboratory or Compute Canada, refer to `docs/Running.md`.
